# Colored Markers
Welcome to my Colored Markers project! This project is my exploration into the world of web development, specifically focusing on color gradients and shadow blur effects using HTML and CSS. It's designed to showcase colorful markers with smooth gradients and subtle shadow effects.

## Features:
#### HTML Structure: 
The project consists of HTML elements representing markers, each with its own unique color gradient and shadow effect.
#### CSS Styling: 
CSS is used to apply color gradients, shadow blur effects, and other styling properties to the markers.
#### Gradient Colors: 
I've experimented with various gradient color combinations to create visually appealing markers.
#### Shadow Blur Effects: 
Utilizing CSS shadow properties, I've added blur effects to give the markers a sense of depth and realism.
#### Learning Opportunity: 
As a beginner, this project has allowed me to practice and understand the nuances of color gradients and shadow effects in web development.
## Usage:
#### Open in Browser: 
Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser to view the colored markers.

#### Explore: 
Take a closer look at the markers and observe the color gradients and shadow effects applied to each one.

#### Experiment: 
Feel free to experiment with the CSS styles and properties to create your own custom markers with different colors and effects.

## Contributions:
While this project is primarily a learning exercise for me, contributions and feedback are always welcome! If you have any ideas for improvements, additional effects, or enhancements to the markers, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request on GitHub.
